# Project Overview

This project uses the Spotify REST Web API that allows users to search for albums, artists, and songs. It contains both a backend and frontend, along with using JSON web tokens.

# Prerequisites

(There will probably be more prerequisites added as development continues and I figure out what is necessary to run the project.)

- NodeJS >= v20.3.3
- npm >= v9.3.1
- MongoDB Server
- Web Browser (latest)
- Port 3001

# Getting Started

After installing all required modules, put in your MongoDB connection string and database name into a .env file (DB_HOST as connection string, DB_NAME as database name).
Afterwards, run "npm start" in a terminal, and everything should be working.
