# Project Overview

This project uses the Spotify REST Web API that allows users to search for albums, artists, and songs. It contains both a backend and frontend, along with using JSON web tokens.

# Prerequisites

(There will probably be more prerequisites added as development continues and I figure out what is necessary to run the project.)

- NodeJS
- npm
- MongoDB
- Web Browser
- Ports 3000 & 3001
